\# FDV Flight Logger



FDV Flight Logger is an Android application designed for flight simulation pilots to log, review, and export detailed flight data. It is optimized for tablets while remaining fully usable on modern phones.



The app is built with Jetpack Compose, Material 3, and Room, and is intended for use with virtual airlines such as FlyDelta Virtual (FDV), though it remains adaptable for broader VA use.
